## Description
This repository contains various material for the assignments made during Internet of Things course held at La Sapienza University of Rome. Those assignment consist in the development of a weather cloud platform, where:

* A *station* (at least one) retrieves values (such as temperature, humidity...) from different sensors, and publish its state in a topic provided by an* MQTT Broker*, hosted by the *Cloud Platform*.
* The *MQTT broker* triggers a procedure which stores the data in a record that will be inserted in a NoSql database.
* A *web application* receives the data in order to show them to the final user.

This platform has been developed using the tools provided by the [AWS Platform](https://console.aws.amazon.com), such as IoTCore, DynamoDB and ElasticBeanstalk. 

## First assignment
here the main parts of the infrastructure , such as the client and the web application, are developed using the javascript programming language, upon the Node.js runtime. In particular:

* the station is a CLI application, located in the environment_station that can be launched by using the following command. The values from the sensors are retrieved by calling the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and published through the topic provided in the configuration file. Then, we can launch many instances of it by typing
```
node .\env_station.js *name of the city* *country code of the city* 
```
* the web application, located in the server folder, must be filled with the *.ebestension* folder in order to be deployed on *Elastic Beanstalk*.

### Instructions
After downloading the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/FlowerOfTheBridges/IoTWeatherStation
```
install the following dependencies:

```
npm install axios
```
in order to call the weather API. Then
```
npm install aws-iot-device-sdk
```
in order to use the *MQTTClient* class, then
```
npm install aws-sdk
```
in order to retrieve data from *DynamoDB*. Last
```
npm install express
npm install body-parser
```
to run the server.
### Last remarks
More insights on how to setup the AWS infrastructure can be found at the [following article published on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/first-approach-iot-virtual-enviromental-station-aws-core-fiordeponti).
Also, a demonstration of how the system works can be found in the video below.
